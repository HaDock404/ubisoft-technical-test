# Ubisoft – Data Scientist Technical Test

This repository contains my solution to the technical test for the Data Scientist position at Ubisoft.

The objective of this test is to analyze a player session dataset, assess data quality, explore player behavior, and build a simple classification model to predict whether a given player-session is the player’s last session.


## Output format

The main deliverable is the Jupyter notebook:

- `technical_test_data.ipynb`  
- An PDF export of the notebook is also provided for easier review.
